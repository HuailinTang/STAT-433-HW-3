## Problem 1

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)

sum(is.na(flights$dep_time))
print(head((flights[is.na(flights$dep_time),])))
```
In flights which have NA in dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay, air_time are also missing. The story might be these flights are cancelled.
